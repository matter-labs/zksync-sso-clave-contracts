A user & developer friendly modular smart account implementation on ZKsync;
simplifying user authentication, session management, and transaction processing.

Forked from [Clave](https://github.com/getclave/clave-contracts).

## Features and Goals

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!CAUTION]
> The factory and module interfaces are not yet stable! Any modules created
> against the IModuleValidator interface will likely need to be updated in the
> final version. The code is currently under audit and the latest may contain
> security vulnerabilities.

See the [ZKsync SSO](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-sso) project for a
complete developer solution, this project is just the smart contract components.
